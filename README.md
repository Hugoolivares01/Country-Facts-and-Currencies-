Displays information about a selected country and creates a currency converter for the country 

## Description

This application was designed as a tool to anyone who is curious about a country and wants to convert from US dollar to a foreign currency. The user selects a country from a list generated from the REST Countries API. The selected country name is displayed at top of the page as well as its flag, capital city, population, and a link to a google map. A currency coverter is displayed which allows user input. When the user inputs a numerical value, it is converted from the US dollar to the foreign currency using the frankfurter API.
